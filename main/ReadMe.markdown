
# Web3-App: AI-Supported Music Platform

## 1. Idea and Value
This project focuses on demonstrating the potential of AI and blockchain technology within the music industry :D

### üéµ AI-Generated Music & Ownership via NFTs

AI makes it possible to create music within minutes using simple text prompts, even without musical experience. But questions about copyright and ownership of these AI-generated songs are still open in many countries.

### üîê Ownership and Copyright

This project aims to support music creation with AI by helping creators prove ownership of their songs. Every track can be linked to a unique NFT based on the ERC-721 standard, serving as a digital certificate of ownership. This gives creators a way to protect their work and verify authorship, even when traditional copyright offices may not recognize AI-generated content.

### üåê Blockchain & Licensing

Thanks to blockchain and decentralized technologies, transferring or selling music ownership is easier and more transparent. The platform will support:

- **Creators**: to register and manage ownership of their AI-generated songs.
- **Content creators**: to legally use music by purchasing **Copyright-NFTs**.
- **Fans**: to engage through **Fan-NFTs**, which can offer access to exclusive content related to a song or artist.

### üìÑ Legal Context

In some cases, copyright authorities do not grant protection for AI-generated works. For example, see [this article from Suno](https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2746945). This platform offers an alternative method to document and verify ownership, using blockchain instead of relying solely on traditional systems.

This approach offers a practical way to handle rights and ownership in the new landscape of AI-generated music.

## 2. Requirements

### üéì University Project Requirements

This application is being developed as part of a university project for the following courses:

1. **Aktuelle Trends der Programmierung**  ‚Äî Prof. Dr. Thomas Str√∂der  
2. **Project: WEB-App** ‚Äî Prof. Dr. Christian Soltenborn

Both courses are at the *Fachhochschule der Wirtschaft (FHDW)* in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.

To meet requirements of the courses, the project must fulfill the following:

- **Aktuelle Trends in der Programmierung**  
  Smart contracts must be implemented in **Solidity**. The source code will be reviewed and presented, so it should showing the strengths and vulnerabilities of the language in compare to another programming languages.

- **WEB-App**  
  The application must follow a **client-server architecture**.
